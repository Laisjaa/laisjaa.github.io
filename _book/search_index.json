Experienced in processing large biological datasets, developing scripts for data visualization, and using bioinformatics software to analyze genomic data. Passionate about research, with a particular interest in the intersection of data science and genomics. Looking to apply my skills in data analysis and biological research in an internship or research assistant position.

I’m really excited to dive deeper into the field and become comfortable with using tools like R to analyze biological data. To get there, I’m committed to improving my programming and problem-solving skills every day, whether it’s by working on coding exercises, learning new bioinformatics techniques, or experimenting with real-world datasets. I’m eager to continue learning and apply what I know to actual bioinformatics problems, whether in academic projects or through personal practice. "],["new-skill.html", "9 new skill", " 9 new skill Furthermore, because of the experience with the RNA-sequencing in the DAUR2 project, i would like to deepen my understanding by putting my research on protein-protein interactions, more specifically in cancer cells. The protein P53 is the protein most associated with cancer because it acts as a tumor Supressor function, DNA pair regulation and prevents mutations. Mutation in this particular protein, causes over 50% of cancers. The goal is to understand how p53 mutations contribute to cancer progression. This goal is reached by retrieving p53 mutation data from cancer databases like NCI and find where the mutations frequently occur. Then use online tools on how the mutations change the structure and the way the p53 protein functions(Protein Data Bank). Then p53 gets mapped out to see which other protein interacts with p53 and see how these interactions are affected by mutations. Lastly, the dataset, RNA-seq from cancer samples, gets used to check if the mutationof p53 alters the expression of specific genes (Rstudio) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
